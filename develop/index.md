# Bulk RNAseq workshop

Repository for bulk RNAseq course of the Danish Health Data Science Sandbox project.

This workshop contains a basic tutorial on how to approach RNAseq data, starting from your count. Thus, the workshop does not include any information about laboratory protocols, library preparation or any wet-lab related procedures. This workshop is based on the materials developed by members of the teaching team at the [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC)](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/), a collection of modified tutorials from the [DESeq2](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) and R language vignettes.

## Goals

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to analyse your own bulk RNAseq count matrix:
  - Normalize your data.
  - Explore your samples with PCAs and heatmaps.
  - Perform Differential Expression Analysis.
  - Annotate your results.

## Syllabus

1. Introduction to bulk-RNASeq
2. Setup
3. Experimental planning
4. Intro to the data
5. Preprocessing overview
6. RNAseq data
7. Exploratory analysis
8. Differential Expression Analysis
9. Functional Analysis
10. Summarized workflow

## Workshop requirements

- Knowledge of R, Rstudio and Rmarkdown. It is recommended that you have at least followed our workshop [R basics](https://github.com/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/FromExceltoR_2022)
- Basic knowledge of RNAseq technology
- Basic knowledge of data science and statistics such as PCA, clustering and statistical testing

## Intended use

The aim of this repository is to run a comprehensive but introductory workshop on bulk-RNAseq bioinformatic analyses. Each of the modules of this workshop is accompanied by a powerpoint slideshow explaining the steps and the theory behind a typical bioinformatics analysis (ideally with a teacher). Many of the slides are annotated with extra information and/or point to original sources for extra reading material.

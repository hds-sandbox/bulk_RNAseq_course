Jennifer (Jennie) is the Sandbox project manager from the Center for Health Data Science at the University of Copenhagen. Jennie has a broad background in computational systems biology, bioinformatics, and health data modeling. Her PhD and postdoc work also included high throughput phenotyping and long read sequencing of bacterial strain libraries, so she can also speak 'wet lab' with experimentalists interested in gaining data science skills. In addition to project management, she's developing 'HPC lab' content and is knowledgable about research data management. She has been deeply involved in the synthetic health data arm of the project, which has turned into a collaborative research project between her, Anders Krogh, Martin Boegsted, and Jan Trzaskowski with a 4 year data science grant from the NNF.
